🤖 BotTrainer – LLM-Based NLU Model Trainer & Evaluator

BotTrainer is an LLM-powered Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system designed for chatbot applications.
Instead of training traditional machine learning models, this project uses prompt engineering and few-shot learning with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform intent classification and evaluate performance using standard ML metrics.

🚀 Key Features

🔍 Intent Classification using LLMs (LLaMA 3 via Groq – free & fast)

🧠 Prompt Engineering & Few-Shot Learning

📊 Model Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

📉 Confusion Matrix Visualization

🧪 Structured JSON Output Enforcement

🖥️ Interactive Multi-Page Streamlit UI

🧩 Modular, ML-style Project Architecture

📝 Centralized Logging & Custom Exception Handling

🛠️ Tech Stack
### Changes
